    !unbalacnce are the type of tree where the right get pretty heavy right measn that right from the root node gets pretty heavier can cost us a lot time and our time becomes O(n) since there's one gaint side so we have to travers like typically we do

                        /-\      /-\

                                        /-\

    you see that the right get pretty heavy right and now if we want to item at the last we'd have to travers like linked list
//*we can solve this problem by using the balanced tree like AVL or red black tree
