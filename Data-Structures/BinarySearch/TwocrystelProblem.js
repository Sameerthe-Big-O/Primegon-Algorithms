//*so we basically jump off the sqrt in an array

//*why we don't just implement the  binary search because if you closely look let's udnerstand by the example 

//*[false,false, true,true,true, true, true];


//*after taking the mid and compare mid we'd be like ahh we  got t  true ohh ohkay means we've to move left but let;s say we again take mid point which'll  be in that case 1 now 1 isn't true
