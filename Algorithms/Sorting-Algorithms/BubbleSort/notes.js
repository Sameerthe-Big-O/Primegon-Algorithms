//*each item is called the vertex or node
//*nodes are then connected with edges
//*model real things and best where we have connections many things

//*when we have the value represent on the edges called weighted graph
//*when we don't have values on the edges they're called unweighted graph

//*edge is simple a line that connects two node 

    //*example of weighted graph
    //*each node represents a city and each edge represent a road between two cities
    //*the weight of the edge represents the distance or the cost of the road

//for unweighted graph we don't have weight on the edges

//*direct vs undirected graph
    //*directed graph - if the edge is going from one node to another, but can't go backwards then that graph is called directed graph like one way road we can to that road but not exactly they way we came on road means not directly
    //*undirected graph - if the edge is going from one node to another, and if we can go to backwards then that graph is called undirected graph like highway we can in both directions like bidirectional


    //*when we have vertex connected in a fashion where  it formed circle it's called Cyclic otherwise it's called Acyclic graph
