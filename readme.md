This repo is a quick guide for students who want to revise Data Structures and Algorithms (for junior roles) by Fav PM. This repo contains all the most common concepts you might encounter (fun fact: Dijkstra's algorithm isn't as difficult as you think). Currently, I'm working on this repo. If you see it empty, then I'm probably learning these topics myself.

Happy studying and coding! 🚀
